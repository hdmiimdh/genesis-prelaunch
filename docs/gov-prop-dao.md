# Terp Network - Pre-Genesis State

### Summary

Hi! This proposal is a request for consensus of the genesis file used for collecting gentxs, as well as the timeline & method. All of the proposed content including the genesis file, the initial state parameters, the scripts used to create the genesis file, and the gentx instructions can be found here.

### Details
 
## Timeline

The propsed timeline for all genesis parameters is as follows:

1. Gentx Collection - April 3rd 00:00UTC to April 6th 00:00UTC [gentx-instructions](https://github.com/terpnetwork/genesis-prelaunch)

2. Final Genesis Proposal on Terp Network - April 6th ~05:00UTC 

This will happen on-chain, and will include the final genesis file that we propose to use for the genesis state.

3. Main-Net Launch - April 10th 12:00:00UTC

We will know the sentiment of the vote status from Terp Network before the voting period is over, so we can use this time to prepare nodes as needed for production launch of Terp Network! :)

**BY VOTING YES you agree to the proposed outline above, including the inital state parameters included in the genesis file to be used for generating each gentx.**

**BY VOTING NO you do not agree to the proposed outline above.**
